  - question: "What is a mullion in window terminology?"
    answer: "A mullion is a vertical structural element that divides a window into separate sections or lights. Unlike glazing bars (which are decorative), mullions are load-bearing and create distinct window openings within a larger frame."
  - question: "What's the difference between sash and casement windows?"
    answer: "Sash windows slide vertically up and down in tracks, typically with two moveable panels. Casement windows are hinged on one side and open outward like doors. Sash windows are traditional, while casements offer better ventilation and easier cleaning."
  - question: "What is low-E glass and why does it matter?"
    answer: "Low-E (low-emissivity) glass has a microscopic metallic coating that reflects heat back into rooms while allowing light through. It significantly improves energy efficiency, reducing heat loss in winter and heat gain in summer."
  - question: "What does FENSA certification mean for window installation?"
    answer: "FENSA (Fenestration Self-Assessment Scheme) is the UK's leading competent person scheme for window installation. FENSA-certified installers can self-certify their work complies with Building Regulations, eliminating the need for separate building control approval."
  - question: "What is a thermal break in aluminium windows?"
    answer: "A thermal break is an insulating barrier within aluminium window frames that prevents heat transfer between inner and outer frame sections. Without thermal breaks, aluminium frames conduct heat and cold, reducing energy efficiency significantly."

## A

### **Argon Gas**
Inert gas used between glass panes in double and triple glazing. Argon is denser than air, reducing heat transfer and improving insulation. Standard in quality double glazing, adding approximately £20-30 per window but improving U-values by 0.1-0.2 W/m²K.

### **Astragal Bars**
Decorative glazing bars that sit on the glass surface, creating the appearance of individual panes without affecting the sealed unit. More cost-effective than Georgian bars but less authentic in appearance.

### **Awning Window**
A window hinged at the top that opens outward from the bottom. Popular in modern architecture, awning windows provide ventilation even during light rain and offer good security when partially open.

## B

### **Bay Window**
A window that projects outward from the main wall, creating additional interior space and enhanced views. Available in various angles (30°, 45°, 90°), bay windows typically cost 30-50% more than equivalent flat windows due to complex installation requirements.

### **BFRC (British Fenestration Rating Council)**
Independent organisation that provides energy efficiency ratings for windows. BFRC labels (similar to appliance energy labels) show overall energy rating, U-value, and annual energy costs, making window comparison straightforward.

### **Bow Window**
Similar to bay windows but with a curved projection rather than angled sections. Bow windows create elegant curved interior spaces but require specialist installation and typically cost more than bay windows.

## C

### **Casement Window**
The most common UK window type, hinged on one side and opening outward like a door. Casement windows offer excellent ventilation, easy cleaning from inside, and good security when fitted with quality locks.

**Oliver's Note:** "Casement windows are my go-to recommendation for most homes – they're versatile, efficient, and cost-effective."

### **Cavity Wall**
Standard UK construction method with two walls separated by an insulating gap. Window installation in cavity walls requires careful consideration of thermal bridging and insulation continuity around the frame.

### **Cill (Window Sill)**
The horizontal ledge at the bottom of a window opening, both inside and outside. External cills must slope away from the building to shed water, while internal cills provide decorative finishing and additional display space.

## D

### **Double Glazing**
Two panes of glass separated by an insulating gap, typically 12-20mm wide. Standard in UK construction since the 1990s, double glazing reduces heat loss by 50-70% compared to single glazing and significantly improves noise reduction.

### **Draught Proofing**
Sealing systems that prevent air leakage around window frames. Quality draught proofing can reduce heat loss by 10-15% and eliminate uncomfortable draughts. Look for brush seals, compression seals, or magnetic strips depending on window type.

### **DGU (Double Glazed Unit)**
The complete glass assembly in double glazing, including both panes, spacer bar, desiccant, and edge sealing. DGUs are manufactured in specialist facilities and cannot be repaired if the seal fails – replacement is the only option.

## E

### **Espagnolette**
Multi-point locking system common in casement windows, where turning the handle engages locks at multiple points around the frame. Provides excellent security and weather sealing but requires quality mechanisms to prevent failure.

### **Energy Rating**
BFRC classification from A++ (most efficient) to G (least efficient), considering U-value, solar gain, and air leakage. A-rated windows typically reduce heating bills by £15-25 per square metre annually compared to C-rated alternatives.

## F

### **Fanlight**
Small window above a door or larger window, originally designed for ventilation. Modern fanlights are often fixed (non-opening) and used for additional natural light in hallways and entrances.

### **FENSA**
Fenestration Self-Assessment Scheme – the UK's leading competent person scheme for window installation. FENSA-certified installers can self-certify Building Regulations compliance, saving homeowners time and money on separate approvals.

### **Fixed Light**
Non-opening window panel, typically used alongside opening windows for maximum light with reduced cost. Fixed lights are 20-30% cheaper than equivalent opening windows and offer better security and weather sealing.

## G

### **Georgian Bars**
Glazing bars that divide glass into smaller panes, either within the sealed unit (authentic appearance) or applied to surfaces (cost-effective option). True Georgian bars affect thermal performance but provide authentic period character.

### **G-Value (Solar Factor)**
Measure of solar heat gain through glass, from 0 (no solar gain) to 1 (maximum solar gain). High G-values (0.6-0.7) benefit south-facing windows for free winter heating, while low G-values (0.3-0.5) prevent overheating in west-facing rooms.

### **Glazing Bead**
Removable strip that holds glass in the window frame. External glazing beads should be avoided for security – quality windows have internal beads that cannot be removed from outside.

## H

### **Head**
The top horizontal member of a window frame. The head must support the weight of the glass and provide weather sealing at the junction with the wall above.

### **Hinges**
Hardware that allows windows to open and close. Quality hinges are crucial for smooth operation and longevity – look for stainless steel or galvanised options with 10+ year warranties.

## I

### **IGU (Insulated Glass Unit)**
Another term for sealed double or triple glazed units. IGUs contain desiccant to absorb moisture and inert gases (argon or krypton) for improved insulation.

### **Ironmongery**
Collective term for window hardware including handles, hinges, locks, and stays. Quality ironmongery can cost £50-150 per window but significantly affects operation, security, and longevity.

## J

### **Jamb**
The vertical sides of a window frame or opening. Jambs must provide structural support and weather sealing, and accommodate hinges or sliding mechanisms depending on window type.

### **Joist**
Horizontal structural timber supporting floors or ceilings. Window installation may require joist modification, particularly for large openings or structural glazing.

## K

### **Krypton Gas**
Premium inert gas used in high-performance glazing, offering better insulation than argon but at higher cost. Krypton allows thinner cavities while maintaining performance, beneficial for heritage applications requiring slim profiles.

## L

### **Laminated Glass**
Safety glass with plastic interlayer that holds fragments together if broken. Laminated glass provides security, noise reduction, and UV protection but costs 30-50% more than standard glass.

### **Lintel**
Structural beam above window openings that supports the wall above. Lintels must be adequate for the window size and wall loading – undersized lintels cause cracking and structural problems.

### **Low-E Glass**
Low-emissivity glass with microscopic metallic coating that reflects heat while allowing light through. Low-E coatings improve U-values by 0.3-0.5 W/m²K and are standard in quality double glazing.

## M

### **Mullion**
Vertical structural element dividing windows into separate sections. Unlike glazing bars, mullions are load-bearing and create distinct window openings within larger frames.

### **Meeting Rail**
Horizontal members where sash windows meet when closed. Meeting rails must provide weather sealing and security, often incorporating locks and draught seals.

## N

### **Newel**
Structural post in bay or bow windows that supports the window weight and transfers loads to foundations. Newels require careful design and installation to prevent settlement and cracking.

### **Noise Reduction**
Sound insulation provided by windows, measured in decibels (dB). Standard double glazing provides 25-35dB reduction, while acoustic glazing achieves 40-50dB reduction for traffic noise control.

## O

### **Opening Light**
Part of a window that opens, as opposed to fixed lights. Opening lights cost more than fixed equivalents but provide ventilation, emergency egress, and cleaning access.

### **Oriel Window**
Bay window supported by brackets or corbels rather than extending to ground level. Oriel windows are common in Tudor and Victorian architecture and require specialist structural support.

## P

### **PAS 24**
Enhanced security standard for windows and doors, tested against burglary attempts. PAS 24 certification indicates resistance to common attack methods and is often required by insurance companies for high-risk areas.

### **Passive House**
Ultra-low energy building standard requiring exceptional window performance (typically U-values under 0.8 W/m²K). Passive House windows cost 50-100% more than standard options but eliminate heating requirements.

## Q

### **Quadruple Glazing**
Four panes of glass with three insulating cavities, achieving U-values under 0.5 W/m²K. Quadruple glazing is expensive and heavy, requiring substantial frames, but offers ultimate thermal performance.

## R

### **Rebate**
Stepped recess in window frames that accommodates glass units and provides weather sealing. Rebate design affects thermal performance, water drainage, and glass retention.

### **Reveal**
The internal sides of window openings in thick walls. Deep reveals can cause thermal bridging and require careful insulation detailing during installation.

## S

### **Sash Window**
Traditional window with vertically sliding panels, typically double-hung (both panels move) or single-hung (only bottom panel moves). Sash windows require counterweights or spring balances for operation.

### **Sealed Unit**
Complete double or triple glazed assembly with permanent edge sealing. Sealed unit failure (indicated by condensation between panes) requires complete unit replacement.

### **SHGC (Solar Heat Gain Coefficient)**
American equivalent of G-value, measuring solar heat transmission through glass. SHGC and G-value are interchangeable for UK applications.

## T

### **Thermal Break**
Insulating barrier in aluminium frames preventing heat transfer between inner and outer sections. Thermal breaks are essential for aluminium window efficiency – without them, U-values can exceed 3.0 W/m²K.

### **Tilt and Turn**
European window style that tilts inward from the top for ventilation or turns inward like a door for cleaning and emergency egress. Popular in modern architecture but requires substantial internal clearance.

### **Toughened Glass**
Safety glass heat-treated to increase strength and break into small, relatively harmless pieces. Required by Building Regulations in certain locations including low-level glazing and doors.

### **Triple Glazing**
Three panes of glass with two insulating cavities, achieving U-values of 0.8-1.2 W/m²K. Triple glazing costs 20-40% more than double glazing but offers superior insulation and noise reduction.

## U

### **U-Value**
Measure of heat loss through windows in watts per square metre per degree Kelvin (W/m²K). Lower U-values indicate better insulation – aim for under 1.2 W/m²K for good performance.

### **uPVC**
Unplasticised polyvinyl chloride – the most common UK window frame material. uPVC offers good insulation, low maintenance, and cost-effectiveness but limited colour options and bulky profiles.

## V

### **Vent**
Opening mechanism for controlled ventilation, including trickle vents (small permanent openings) and night vents (secure ventilation positions). Building Regulations often require ventilation provisions in new windows.

### **Venetian Window**
Three-part window with larger central section flanked by narrower side panels. Venetian windows create impressive facades but require careful proportioning and structural support.

## W

### **Warm Edge Spacer**
Insulated spacer bar between glass panes that reduces thermal bridging compared to standard aluminium spacers. Warm edge spacers improve U-values by 0.1-0.3 W/m²K and reduce condensation risk.

### **Weather Bar**
Horizontal barrier at the bottom of door openings that prevents water ingress. Weather bars must be carefully detailed to avoid creating trip hazards while maintaining weather protection.

### **Window Board**
Internal window sill, typically timber, uPVC, or stone. Window boards provide finishing and display space but must accommodate thermal movement and potential condensation.

## X, Y, Z

### **Zone Toughening**
Selective toughening of glass areas that require safety glazing while leaving other areas as standard glass for cost efficiency. Common in large glazed areas where only portions need safety treatment.
