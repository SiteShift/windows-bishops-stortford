  - question: "Which window frame material lasts the longest in the UK climate?"
    answer: "Well-maintained timber frames can last 60-100+ years, while quality aluminium frames typically last 45-60 years. uPVC frames generally last 20-35 years, and composite frames 30-50 years. However, lifespan depends heavily on quality, maintenance, and environmental exposure."
  - question: "What are the real maintenance costs for different frame materials over 25 years?"
    answer: "Timber: £2,000-£4,000 in maintenance costs. uPVC: £200-£500 (mainly cleaning and hardware). Aluminium: £500-£1,200 (occasional repainting). Composite: £800-£1,500 (periodic maintenance). These figures assume proper initial installation and regular care."
  - question: "Can I paint uPVC window frames to change their color?"
    answer: "Yes, but it requires specialist uPVC paint and proper preparation. The paint may need refreshing every 5-8 years. However, many manufacturers now offer colored uPVC profiles that maintain their appearance longer than painted finishes."
  - question: "Which frame material offers the best thermal performance?"
    answer: "Modern timber and composite frames typically offer the best thermal performance (U-values 1.0-1.4 W/m²K), followed by quality uPVC (1.2-1.6 W/m²K), then thermally broken aluminium (1.4-1.8 W/m²K). However, glazing specification has more impact on overall window performance than frame material."

## The 25-Year Test: When Frame Choice Really Matters

"I wish someone had explained this to me 15 years ago," sighed David Chen, looking at the deteriorating uPVC frames on his 1990s extension in Stansted Mountfitchet. "They looked great when new, but now they're discolored, the seals are failing, and the hardware is seized. Meanwhile, the original 1930s timber frames on the main house—which I thought were 'outdated'—are still going strong after some basic maintenance."

David's experience illustrates one of the most important yet misunderstood aspects of window selection: the long-term performance of frame materials. While initial appearance and cost often drive decisions, it's the 20-30 year performance that determines true value.

After nearly four decades of installing, maintaining, and replacing windows in every conceivable material combination, I've witnessed the complete lifecycle of different frame technologies. I've seen £20,000 timber installations still performing beautifully after 50 years, and budget uPVC systems failing after just 12 years. I've watched aluminium frames weather decades of coastal exposure, and composite systems that promised the best of both worlds delivering mixed results.

The truth about window frame materials is more nuanced than marketing brochures suggest. Each material has its sweet spot—conditions where it excels and situations where it struggles. Understanding these characteristics is crucial for making a choice you'll be happy with for decades.

Let me share what I've learned about the real-world performance of different frame materials, and how to choose the right one for your specific situation.

- **Cost:** Premium pricing, especially for high-performance systems
- **Aesthetics:** Industrial appearance may not suit all architectural styles

### Composite Frames: The Hybrid Solution

Composite frames attempt to combine the best characteristics of different materials, typically using timber cores with protective cladding.

**Common configurations:**
- **Timber-aluminium:** Timber internal frame with external aluminium cladding
- **Timber-uPVC:** Timber core with uPVC exterior
- **Engineered timber:** Laminated timber with protective treatments
- **Fiber-reinforced composites:** Advanced polymer systems with various reinforcements

**Performance promises:**
- **Best of both worlds:** Timber's thermal performance with cladding's weather resistance
- **Reduced maintenance:** Protected timber requiring less frequent attention
- **Design flexibility:** Various aesthetic options from single material systems
- **Enhanced durability:** Protected core materials lasting longer

**Reality check:**
- **Complexity:** More components mean more potential failure points
- **Cost:** Often premium pricing for uncertain long-term benefits
- **Repair challenges:** Complex systems can be difficult to maintain or repair
- **Track record:** Limited long-term performance data compared to traditional materials
