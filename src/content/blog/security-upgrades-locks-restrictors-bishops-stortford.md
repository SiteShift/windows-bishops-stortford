# Window Security Upgrades: A Bishop's Stortford Homeowner's Guide

How secure are your windows? It's a question many of us don't think about until it's too late. With police statistics showing that around 30% of burglars gain entry through windows, ensuring they are properly secured is one of the most important things you can do for your family's safety.

I'm Oliver Greene, and with 38 years in the window industry, I've seen firsthand how the right security hardware can deter intruders and provide peace of mind. Today, I'll guide you through the essential window security upgrades for Bishop's Stortford homes, from high-security locks to vital safety restrictors.

Whether you live in a modern new-build or a period property, I'll explain the technology, the standards to look for, and the practical steps you can take to make your home a fortress against unwanted entry.

## Why Window Security is Crucial in Bishop's Stortford

While Bishop's Stortford is a relatively safe area, opportunistic crime can happen anywhere. Older properties, in particular, often have outdated locks that are an easy target for intruders. Upgrading your window security is not just about preventing break-ins; it's about creating a safe environment for your family.

### Key Security Standards to Look For:
- **PAS 24:2016**: The industry standard for security performance. Windows and their hardware are rigorously tested to withstand common attack methods.
- **Secured by Design (SBD)**: The official police security initiative. SBD-approved products are tested to even higher standards and are recommended by police forces across the UK.
- **BS 7950**: The British Standard for enhanced security performance of casement and tilt & turn windows.

## Essential Security Upgrade #1: High-Security Locks

The lock is your first line of defence. If your locks are more than 10-15 years old, they likely don't meet modern security standards.

### Multi-Point Espagnolette Locks (For Casement Windows)
This is the most common and effective lock for modern uPVC and timber casement windows.
- **How it works**: A central gearbox operates a series of mushroom-shaped cams and hooks that lock into keeps along the frame.
- **What to upgrade to**: Look for systems with **shootbolts** (bolts that engage at the top and bottom of the frame) and **hinge-side bolts** for maximum security.

### Sash Window Locks
Traditional sash windows have unique vulnerabilities.
- **Dual Screw Locks**: Two locks are better than one central one, preventing the sashes from being prised apart.
- **Sash Stops/Restrictors**: These allow the window to be opened a small amount for ventilation but prevent it from being opened further from the outside.

### Oliver's Take: The "Bump Key" Threat
In my 38 years, the evolution of lock-picking techniques has been alarming. A common method called "bumping" can open older, less complex locks in seconds. Modern, high-security cylinders are anti-bump, anti-pick, and anti-drill. If your locks are old, upgrading the cylinder is a small investment for a massive security gain. I've advised dozens of Bishop's Stortford residents to do this after neighbourhood watch alerts.

## Essential Security Upgrade #2: Window Restrictors & Safety

Security isn't just about stopping people from getting in; it's also about preventing accidents, especially falls from upper-floor windows.

### Child Safety Restrictors
These are essential for any family home with young children.
- **How they work**: They limit the window opening to a maximum of 100mm (4 inches), preventing a child from falling through. They can be disengaged by an adult in an emergency.
- **Types available**: Cable restrictors and arm-based restrictors.
- **Best Practice**: Fit on all upper-floor windows in children's bedrooms and play areas.

### Fire Escape Hinges (Egress Hinges)
These are a critical safety feature.
- **How they work**: They allow the window to open to a full 90 degrees, providing a large enough opening to escape through in case of a fire.
- **Building Regulations**: Required for any habitable room on an upper floor that doesn't have direct access to a hallway leading to an escape route.

## Essential Security Upgrade #3: Laminated & Toughened Glass

The strength of the glass itself is a major deterrent.

### Laminated Glass
- **How it works**: Two panes of glass are bonded together with a tough plastic interlayer (PVB). When struck, the glass may crack, but it holds together, making entry extremely difficult and noisy.
- **Best for**: Ground floor windows, accessible upper-floor windows, and doors.

### Toughened Glass (Safety Glass)
- **How it works**: The glass is heat-treated to be four to five times stronger than normal glass. If it does break, it shatters into thousands of small, harmless pieces, reducing the risk of injury.
- **Building Regulations**: Required for any glazing below 800mm from floor level, and in and around doors.

## Cost of Window Security Upgrades in Bishop's Stortford

Investing in security is one of the best returns you can get. Here are some typical costs for professional installation in our area:

| Upgrade | Average Cost Per Window | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| High-Security Lock Mechanism | £80 - £150 | Includes parts and labour |
| Child Safety Restrictor | £50 - £90 | Cable or arm type |
| Fire Escape Hinge Pair | £70 - £120 | Essential for safety |
| Laminated Glass (per sq.m.) | £100 - £180 | Upgrade from standard double glazing |
| Full Security Overhaul (per window) | £150 - £300 | Lock, hinges, and restrictor |

A full-house security upgrade for a typical 3-bed home in Bishop's Stortford would generally range from **£600 to £1,200**.

## DIY vs. Professional Installation

While some simple restrictors can be a DIY job, I always recommend professional installation for locks and glass.

- **Insurance Compliance**: Many home insurance policies specify that security devices must be professionally fitted. A DIY installation could void your cover.
- **Correct Specification**: A professional will ensure you have the right lock for your specific window type and that it meets PAS 24 standards.
- **Guaranteed Work**: Professional installation comes with a warranty on both the parts and the labour.

## Oliver's Final Security Checklist for Your Home

Walk around your home and ask yourself these questions. This is the same checklist I've used for 38 years.

- [ ] **Ground Floor**: Are all window locks key-operated? Is the glass laminated?
- [ ] **Upper Floors**: Do bedroom windows have restrictors if children are present? Do they have fire escape hinges?
- [ ] **Accessible Windows**: Are windows above flat roofs or near drainpipes fitted with extra security locks and laminated glass?
- [ ] **Handles**: Do all your handles lock correctly? Are any loose or spinning?
- [ ] **Keys**: Do you know where all your window keys are? Are they kept away from the window, out of sight?

If you answer "no" to any of these, it's time to consider an upgrade.
