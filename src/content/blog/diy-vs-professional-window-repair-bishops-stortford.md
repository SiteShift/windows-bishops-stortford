After decades in this industry, here are the repairs I'm comfortable recommending for capable DIY enthusiasts:

### ✅ Safe DIY Repairs (Difficulty: Easy to Moderate)

#### 1. Replacing Window Handles
**When to DIY**: Handle broken, loose, or won't turn properly
**Tools needed**: Screwdriver, measuring tape
**Cost**: £15-£40 for new handle vs £80-£120 professional call-out

#### 2. Adjusting Window Hinges
**When to DIY**: Window doesn't close properly, catching on frame

### Oliver's Take: The 38-Year Reality Check

In my experience, successful DIY window repair depends on three factors:
1. **Your skill level** – be honest about your capabilities
2. **The right tools** – don't attempt repairs with inadequate equipment
3. **Ground floor access** – never attempt DIY repairs requiring ladders or scaffolding

I've seen too many Bishop's Stortford homeowners turn simple repairs into expensive disasters by overestimating their abilities. There's no shame in calling professionals – it often saves money in the long run.
