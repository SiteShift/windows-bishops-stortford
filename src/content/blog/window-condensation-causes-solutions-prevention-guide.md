  - question: "Is condensation on the inside of my windows a sign they need replacing?"
    answer: "Not necessarily. Internal condensation usually indicates high indoor humidity rather than window failure. Try improving ventilation, using dehumidifiers, and checking for moisture sources before considering replacement. However, condensation between double glazing panes does indicate seal failure requiring attention."
  - question: "Why do I get more condensation in winter even though it's colder outside?"
    answer: "Cold outdoor temperatures create a larger temperature difference between inside and outside surfaces. When warm, humid indoor air contacts the cold window surface, it reaches dew point and condenses. This is why condensation peaks during cold mornings and in poorly ventilated rooms."
  - question: "Can condensation damage my window frames and surrounding walls?"
    answer: "Yes, persistent condensation can cause serious damage including timber rot, paint peeling, wallpaper lifting, and mold growth. It's particularly problematic for timber frames and can lead to expensive structural repairs if not addressed promptly."
  - question: "What's the difference between condensation on windows vs. between the glass panes?"
    answer: "Surface condensation (on room-side glass) is usually a humidity/ventilation issue you can fix. Condensation between panes indicates failed double glazing seals requiring professional repair or replacement of the glazed unit."

## The Morning Mystery: When Windows Weep

"Every morning, our bedroom windows are streaming with water," explained Janet Morrison, standing in her Victorian terrace in Sawbridgeworth. "The sills are soaked, the wallpaper's peeling, and there's a musty smell developing. Are our new double-glazed windows faulty?"

I've heard this concern hundreds of times over nearly four decades in the window industry. The irony? Janet's windows were working perfectly. The real culprit was hiding in plain sight—the daily routines of a busy family creating moisture faster than their home could remove it.

Six months later, after implementing a targeted moisture management strategy, Janet's windows stay clear, her home feels fresher, and the musty odors have disappeared. The solution didn't require new windows—it required understanding the complex relationship between indoor humidity, temperature, and ventilation.

Window condensation isn't just an inconvenience—it's your home's way of telling you about moisture imbalances that can lead to serious structural damage, health issues, and energy waste. But here's the good news: most condensation problems are entirely solvable once you understand what's really happening.

Let me share what I've learned about diagnosing, solving, and preventing window condensation in UK homes.

## Understanding Condensation: The Science Made Simple

Condensation occurs when warm, moisture-laden air meets a surface cold enough to drop the air temperature below its dew point. Think of it as nature's way of wringing water from the air—like squeezing a wet sponge.

**The Basic Physics**

Warm air holds more moisture than cold air. When humid indoor air contacts a cold window surface, it cools rapidly and releases excess moisture as water droplets. The warmer and more humid your indoor air, and the colder your window surfaces, the more condensation you'll see.

**Why Windows Are Condensation Magnets**

Windows are typically the coldest surfaces in your home because:
- **Thin profiles** compared to insulated walls
- **Direct contact** with outdoor temperatures
- **Large surface areas** exposed to room air
- **Thermal bridging** through frames and glazing bars

Even high-performance double glazing will be colder than room temperature on winter mornings, making some condensation almost inevitable in humid conditions.

## The Three Types of Window Condensation

Not all condensation is created equal. Understanding which type you're dealing with determines the appropriate solution:

### 1. Internal Condensation (Room-Side Glass)

**What it looks like:** Water droplets on the inside surface of your windows, typically worst in mornings
**What it means:** High indoor humidity meeting cold glass surfaces
**Severity:** Usually manageable with lifestyle and ventilation changes

**Common causes:**
- Cooking, showering, and breathing without adequate ventilation
- Drying clothes indoors
- Houseplants (especially large numbers)
- Unvented tumble dryers
- Poor heating patterns leaving surfaces cold

### 2. External Condensation (Outside Glass)

**What it looks like:** Dew or frost on the outside of your windows, usually early morning
**What it means:** Your windows are well-insulated! Outdoor humidity condensing on cold exterior surfaces
**Severity:** Actually a good sign—indicates effective insulation

**Why it happens:**
- Clear, cold nights allow window surfaces to cool below dew point
- High-performance glazing stays cold on the outside
- More common with energy-efficient windows
- Usually disappears as sun warms the glass

### 3. Interstitial Condensation (Between Glass Panes)

**What it looks like:** Misty or cloudy appearance between double glazing panes, doesn't wipe away
**What it means:** Failed window seals allowing moisture into the sealed unit
**Severity:** Requires professional attention—indicates window failure

**The problem:**
- Broken perimeter seals allow humid air into the cavity
- Temperature differences cause condensation inside the sealed unit
- Desiccant materials become saturated and ineffective
- Progressive deterioration of insulation performance

## Janet's Case Study: Solving Severe Bedroom Condensation

Janet's Victorian terrace presented classic condensation challenges. Here's how we diagnosed and solved her problem:

### The Investigation

**Symptoms observed:**
- Heavy condensation every morning on bedroom windows
- Water pooling on wooden sills
- Wallpaper peeling around window reveals
- Musty odors in the room
- Black spots appearing on window frames

**Measurements taken:**
- Indoor relative humidity: 68% (should be 40-60%)
- Room temperature variations: 16°C overnight, 21°C during day
- Ventilation assessment: Inadequate air changes per hour
- Moisture sources identified: Ensuite bathroom, clothes drying, houseplants

### The Root Causes

1. **Lifestyle factors:** Family of four creating 12-15 liters of moisture daily
2. **Ventilation inadequacy:** Original Victorian ventilation blocked or removed
3. **Heating patterns:** Thermostat setback overnight creating cold surfaces
4. **Bathroom humidity:** Ensuite shower moisture migrating to bedroom
5. **Thermal performance:** Single-glazed sash windows recently replaced with double glazing (good) but room still poorly insulated

### The Solution Strategy

**Phase 1: Immediate Moisture Control**
- Bathroom extractor fan upgraded and timer installed
- Bedroom door kept closed during and after showers
- Clothes drying moved to utility room
- Three large houseplants relocated to living areas

**Phase 2: Ventilation Improvements**
- Trickle vents installed in new window frames
- Positive input ventilation (PIV) system added to loft
- Humidity-controlled extractor fans in bathroom and kitchen
- Regular window opening schedule established

**Phase 3: Heating Optimization**
- Overnight temperature maintained at 18°C minimum
- Radiator repositioned away from window wall
- Thermal curtains installed with proper clearance
- Room insulation improved where possible

### The Results

**After 6 months:**
- Morning condensation reduced by 90%
- Indoor humidity stabilized at 45-55%
- Wallpaper damage stopped progressing
- Musty odors eliminated
- Window frames showing no further deterioration

**Janet's feedback:** "I wish we'd understood this from the beginning. The windows weren't the problem—we just needed to manage moisture better. Now the bedroom feels fresh every morning."

2. **Upgrade bathroom and kitchen extraction**
3. **Address major moisture sources** (drying, cooking, breathing)
4. **Consider dehumidification** in worst-affected rooms

### Localized Problem Rooms
1. **Improve local ventilation** (extractor fans, trickle vents)
2. **Optimize heating patterns** in affected areas
3. **Reduce local moisture sources**
4. **Consider room-specific dehumidifiers**

### Failed Double Glazing
1. **Replace failed glazed units** promptly
2. **Check other windows** for early signs of failure
3. **Address underlying humidity issues** to prevent recurrence
4. **Consider upgrading** to higher-performance glazing
