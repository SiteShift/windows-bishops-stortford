# How Double Glazing Slashed Energy Bills by £420/Year: Real Bishop's Stortford Case Study

Are you tired of seeing your energy bills climb every year while your draughty windows let precious heat escape? You're not alone. Many Bishop's Stortford homeowners are shocked when they discover just how much their old windows are costing them in wasted energy.

I'm Oliver Greene, and in my 38 years in the window industry, I've helped thousands of Hertfordshire families transform their energy efficiency through quality double glazing. Today, I want to share a real case study from one of my recent projects – a Victorian terrace in Bishop's Stortford where we achieved remarkable energy savings.

The results? A 28% reduction in energy bills, saving the family £420 annually. Here's exactly how we did it, and what it means for your home.

## The Property: A Typical Bishop's Stortford Challenge

Let me introduce you to Sarah and Michael Thompson (names changed for privacy), who live in a beautiful 1890s Victorian terrace on one of Bishop's Stortford's tree-lined residential streets. Like many period properties in the area, their home had charming original features – and original single-glazed sash windows that were bleeding energy.

### Property Details:
- **Built**: 1890 Victorian mid-terrace
- **Size**: 3 bedrooms, 2 reception rooms
- **Windows**: 11 original timber sash windows
- **Heating**: Gas central heating with 10-year-old boiler
- **Previous energy bills**: £1,500 annually

### The Problem:
The Thompsons loved their home's character but were frustrated by:
- Sky-high heating bills despite a relatively new boiler
- Cold drafts making some rooms uncomfortable in winter
- Condensation issues causing mould concerns
- Noise from the nearby A1184 disrupting sleep

## Oliver's Take: The Hidden Cost of Old Windows

In my 38 years of experience, I've seen this scenario countless times. Original windows in period properties often account for 25-30% of total heat loss – but homeowners rarely realise the true cost until we show them the numbers.

When I first visited the Thompsons, I could immediately see the issues:
- **Rattling sash windows** with gaps you could see daylight through
- **Single glazing** providing virtually no thermal barrier
- **Rotting timber frames** compromising the seal
- **Poor draught proofing** around the window openings

Using thermal imaging, we identified that their windows were losing approximately 8,500 kWh of energy annually – equivalent to running a 1kW heater for 8.5 hours every day of the year.

## The Solution: Strategic Double Glazing Upgrade

Rather than a like-for-like replacement, we designed a comprehensive solution that balanced heritage aesthetics with modern efficiency:

### Window Specification:
- **Style**: Heritage timber sash windows with authentic proportions
- **Glazing**: A-rated double glazing with low-E coating
- **Frames**: Accoya timber with superior thermal performance
- **Hardware**: Traditional brass fittings with modern security features
- **Installation**: Full weatherproofing and draught-sealing

### Why We Chose This Approach:
1. **Preserved character** while dramatically improving efficiency
2. **A-rated performance** delivering maximum energy savings
3. **Quality materials** ensuring 25+ year lifespan
4. **Professional installation** by FENSA-certified specialists

## The Results: Impressive Energy Savings

The transformation was remarkable. Here's the detailed breakdown of energy savings achieved:

### Year 1 Energy Bill Comparison:

**Before Double Glazing (2023):**
- Annual gas consumption: 18,500 kWh
- Annual electricity consumption: 3,200 kWh
- Total energy cost: £1,500

**After Double Glazing (2024):**
- Annual gas consumption: 13,200 kWh
- Annual electricity consumption: 3,100 kWh
- Total energy cost: £1,080

**Total Annual Savings: £420 (28% reduction)**

### Monthly Breakdown:
- **Winter months (Dec-Feb)**: £45-55 monthly savings
- **Spring/Autumn (Mar-May, Sep-Nov)**: £25-35 monthly savings
- **Summer months (Jun-Aug)**: £15-20 monthly savings

### Additional Benefits Beyond Energy Savings:

**Comfort Improvements:**
- Room temperatures increased by 2-3°C
- Eliminated cold drafts completely
- Reduced condensation by 90%
- Significantly reduced outside noise

**Property Value Impact:**
- Professional valuation increase: £8,000-£12,000
- Enhanced marketability for future sale
- Improved EPC rating from E to C

## Breaking Down the Energy Science

Let me explain exactly why these windows delivered such impressive savings:

### U-Value Performance:
- **Original single glazing**: U-value 5.0 W/m²K (very poor)
- **New A-rated double glazing**: U-value 1.2 W/m²K (excellent)
- **Improvement**: 75% better thermal performance

### Heat Loss Reduction:
With 35m² of window area, the heat loss improvement was:
- **Before**: 35m² × 5.0 × ΔT = 175 × ΔT watts lost
- **After**: 35m² × 1.2 × ΔT = 42 × ΔT watts lost
- **Reduction**: 76% less heat loss through windows

### Annual Energy Impact:
This improvement saved approximately 5,300 kWh annually – enough energy to power the average UK home for nearly 2 months.

## What Made This Project So Successful?

After 38 years in this industry, I know that exceptional results require attention to detail:

### 1. Proper Assessment
We conducted thermal imaging surveys to identify all heat loss points, not just obvious problems.

### 2. Quality Materials
We specified A-rated double glazing with low-E coatings and argon gas fills for maximum efficiency.

### 3. Professional Installation
Our FENSA-certified installers ensured perfect sealing and weatherproofing around every window.

### 4. Comprehensive Approach
We addressed draught-proofing, frame sealing, and thermal bridging for complete efficiency gains.
