Timing your project for optimal conditions and availability:

Yes, but this increases overall project time and costs. Most homeowners find it more convenient and cost-effective to complete all windows together.

### What if weather delays installation?
Professional installers reschedule for safe working conditions. Indoor preparation work can often continue, but actual installation requires suitable weather.

### How much disruption should I expect?
Installation is usually completed within 1-2 days with minimal disruption. Rooms remain habitable throughout, though some noise and dust is normal.
