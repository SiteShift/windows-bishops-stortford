  - question: "How long does a typical window survey take?"
    answer: "A full-house survey (10-15 windows) usually takes 60-90 minutes. Smaller properties may take as little as 30 minutes, while complex period homes can require two hours or more."
  - question: "Is a window survey really free, or are there hidden charges?"
    answer: "A reputable installer will always offer a free, no-obligation survey. If a company tries to charge, consider it a red flag and seek other quotes."
  - question: "Do I need to move furniture or remove blinds before the survey?"
    answer: "It helps. Clearing the immediate area around each window speeds up measuring and allows accurate inspection of frames, sills and reveals."
  - question: "Will the surveyor pressure me to sign a contract on the spot?"
    answer: "Professional firms never push same-day sign-ups. Expect a detailed written quote within 48-72 hours so you can compare calmly."

## Why the Window Survey Matters More Than the Showroom Visit

When homeowners invite me into their property for an *in-home window survey*, they often assume I’m there simply to take a few measurements before firing off a quote. In reality, the survey is the **single most important stage** of any window project. It’s where potential problems are uncovered, expectations are aligned, and future headaches are quietly avoided.

I’ve spent 38 years crawling over Victorian sash boxes, measuring awkward stone mullions on listed cottages, and truth-telling about hidden lintel damage no one else wanted to mention. During that time I’ve learned that a thorough survey delivers three priceless outcomes:

1.  **Accuracy** – millimetre-perfect dimensions mean your new windows fit first time.
2.  **Transparency** – you know *every* cost upfront, from scaffolding to FENSA registration (see our article on [hidden window costs](/blog/hidden-window-installation-costs-bishops-stortford)).
3.  **Peace of mind** – no mysterious “extras” added once installers start dismantling your house.

So let’s walk through what actually happens, minute by minute, when a genuine professional visits your Bishop’s Stortford home.

## Before the Doorbell Rings: How to Prepare

A little preparation turns a stressful afternoon into a relaxed, efficient visit.

*   **Clear access** to every window, inside and out. Move sofas, take down heavy curtains, pop flower pots off sills.
*   **Have questions ready.** Energy ratings, frame colours, Part L compliance—write them down so nothing is forgotten.
*   **Locate paperwork** for any previous installations. FENSA certificates or planning approvals help the surveyor understand your home’s history.

> **Tip:** If you’re unsure which window style suits your property, browse our [Window Types Guide](/window-types) first. It helps you talk specifics instead of vague preferences.

## Step-by-Step: Inside a Professional Survey

### 1. The Brief Conversation (5 minutes)

We start around the kitchen table. I listen to your goals—better energy efficiency? Quieter bedrooms? Restoring period character? This context guides every measurement and recommendation that follows.

### 2. Exterior Inspection (10 minutes)

Before touching a tape measure, I walk the perimeter:

*   **Brickwork & lintels** – cracks, deflection, or previous movement.
*   **Sill condition** – rot in timber, spalling concrete, failed lead flashing.
*   **Access challenges** – conservatory roofs, steep flowerbeds, or neighbouring walls that might require scaffold towers.

A quick ladder check often saves hundreds later by spotting hidden rot under paint.

### 3. Interior Assessment & Measuring (30–60 minutes)

Room by room we record:

*   **Reveals & plaster lines** – ensuring new frames cover existing paint lines for a neat finish.
*   **Depth of window board** – vital for flush casements or integral blinds.
*   **Opening direction & safety** – egress compliance for bedrooms, restrictors above ground level (detailed in our guide on [window security upgrades](/blog/window-security-upgrades-locks-restrictors-bishops-stortford)).
*   **Moisture or mould** – signs of failed ventilation that new trickle vents must address.

Each aperture gets three horizontal and three vertical measurements (top, middle, bottom). Victorian reveals are rarely square; averaging prevents shock gaps on installation day.

### 4. Discussion of Materials & Options (15 minutes)

With dimensions captured, we revisit your brief. Here’s where samples come out of the van:

*   Slimline aluminium vs timber sash profiles.
*   Colour swatches—anthracite grey, heritage cream, dual-colour options.
*   Glass packages—standard double glazing, triple glazing, or acoustic upgrades.

Because you’ve seen the frames against your décor and brickwork, decisions made now tend to *stick*, avoiding mid-order changes and delays.

### 5. Compliance & Paperwork (10 minutes)

I confirm:

*   **FENSA registration** – included in the quote.
*   **Planning requirements** – conservation area? Listed building? I outline next steps.
*   **Finance options** – if required, directing you to our transparent [window finance guide](/window-costs-finance).

### 6. The Wrap-Up (5 minutes)

We agree a timeline:

*   Detailed written quote within 48 hours.
*   Survey drawings emailed for your records.
*   Provisional installation week, subject to order confirmation.

No hard-sell, no “today only” discounts. Quality work sells itself.

## What Happens After the Survey?

Within two days you’ll receive a **line-item quotation**. Expect to see:

*   Frame material, colour, and glazing spec for each window
*   Unit price and total price (incl. VAT)
*   Extras: scaffolding, integral blinds, disposal of old frames
*   Lead times and payment schedule

> **Important:** Compare *like-for-like*. A cheaper quote that swaps A-rated argon-filled glass for B-rated air-filled units isn’t cheaper; it’s a downgrade dressed as a bargain.

If you accept, the technical team orders bespoke frames to the survey’s millimetre-perfect sizes. Four to six weeks later, installation begins—no nasty surprises because everything was captured on survey day.

## Red Flags & How to Avoid Cowboy Surveys

1.  **No ladder outside.** A ground-level glance misses critical issues.
2.  **Single quick measurement** per window. Old houses aren’t square.
3.  **Pressure to sign** before the rep leaves. Walk them politely to the door.
4.  **Cash discounts** for immediate deposit—reputable firms don’t operate like that.
5.  **Ambiguous paperwork** – if it isn’t in writing, assume it’s not included.
