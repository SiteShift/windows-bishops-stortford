faq:
  - question: "Do aluminium windows still suffer from condensation?"
    answer: "Modern aluminium frames have polyamide thermal breaks that virtually eliminate internal condensation, provided humidity is controlled indoors."
  - question: "How often do uPVC windows need replacing compared to aluminium?"
    answer: "Quality uPVC typically lasts 25-30 years before discoloration or warping becomes noticeable; premium aluminium can exceed 40 years with minimal maintenance."
  - question: "Are aluminium windows really more secure than uPVC?"
    answer: "Both can meet PAS 24 security standards, but aluminium’s inherent strength allows slimmer profiles without compromising resistance to forced entry."
  - question: "Can I paint uPVC windows if I change my exterior colour scheme?"
    answer: "Yes, but specialist paints are required and longevity is unpredictable. Aluminium’s powder-coated finish is factory-applied and colour-stable for 25+ years."

## Price Tag vs Price Paid: Why Lifetime Cost Beats Upfront Quotes

When Sophie and Mark Cartwright bought their 1990s detached home in Thorley, every original uPVC window had yellowed to a nicotine tinge. Two quotes landed on their kitchen table:

* £9,600 for A-rated **uPVC** replacements
* £14,800 for identical-looking **aluminium** frames in anthracite grey

“Fifteen grand for windows? No chance,” Mark muttered. Yet ten days of spreadsheet wizardry later, he signed the aluminium contract—and he’s been smiling about it ever since. This article explains why.

### The Big Picture

Most buying decisions stop at the invoice total, but windows live with you for decades. A thorough evaluation considers:

1. **Initial purchase & installation**  
2. **Energy performance** and heating-bill impact  
3. **Maintenance & repair** costs over time  
4. **Lifespan & replacement cycle**  
5. **Resale value & kerb appeal**

Let’s break each down using local data, manufacturer specs, and real homeowner experiences—including the Cartwrights’ meticulous 10-year cost log.

---

## 1 — Upfront Cost

| Material | Typical Price per m² (installed) | Example Cartwright Project |
|---------|----------------------------------|----------------------------|
| uPVC (A-rated) | £500 | £9,600 total (19 windows) |
| Aluminium (A-rated) | £800 | £14,800 total (19 windows) |

Aluminium starts **~50-60 % higher**. Case closed? Not so fast.

---

## 2 — Energy Efficiency

Both materials can hit stellar U-values. The delta lies in longevity:

* **uPVC** starts at 1.3 W/m²K but can creep upward as gaskets shrink and frames warp.
* **Aluminium** with thermal breaks maintains ~1.1 W/m²K for decades because metal doesn’t warp and seals stay evenly compressed.

Cartwright gas-usage records (adjusted for degree-days):

| Year | uPVC Estimate* | Aluminium Actual | Annual Saving |
|------|---------------|-----------------|---------------|
| 1 | 16,200 kWh | 15,100 kWh | £98 |
| 5 | 16,600 kWh | 15,150 kWh | £144 |
| 10 | 17,100 kWh | 15,200 kWh | £196 |

*Projected using historic data from equivalent houses on the street that chose uPVC.

**Cumulative energy saving after 10 years: £1,430** (at 11 p/kWh average).

---

## 3 — Maintenance & Repair

| Task | uPVC | Aluminium |
|------|------|-----------|
| Re-sealing gaskets (every 7–10 yrs) | £45 per window | Rarely needed |
| Hinge/handle replacements | Similar cost but more frequent on uPVC due to frame flex | Less frequent |
| Cleaning | Can stain; may need specialist products | Simple detergent wash |

The Cartwrights’ neighbours spent **£1,050** on uPVC repairs in year 9. The aluminium frames? £0.

## 4 — Lifespan & Colour Stability

Quality uPVC resists fading for 15 years, then slowly chalks—especially south-facing elevations. Re-spraying is possible (~£180 per window) but rarely perfect.

Powder-coated aluminium maintains colour for 25–30 years before subtle matte fading. No warping means seals compress evenly and glass remains square, extending unit life.

Industry data suggests:

* **uPVC full replacement cycle:** 25–30 years  
* **Aluminium cycle:** 40–45 years

Over 40 years, you’ll likely buy uPVC **twice**.

---

## 5 — Resale Value & Aesthetics

Estate agents confirm what Rightmove data shows: homes with modern anthracite aluminium frames sell **2–4 % faster** and at around **1 % higher** final price than identical properties with white uPVC. Buyers equate slim aluminium sightlines with contemporary quality.

On a £550,000 Bishop’s Stortford home, that 1 % equates to **£5,500**—already covering over a third of aluminium’s cost premium.

## 10-Year Cost Comparison: Crunching the Numbers

| Cost Element | uPVC (£) | Aluminium (£) | Notes |
|--------------|---------|---------------|-------|
| Initial purchase | 9,600 | 14,800 | Cartwright project figures |
| Energy (10 yrs) | 9,350 | 7,920 | Based on gas records & projections |
| Maintenance | 1,200 | 200 | Gasket & hardware over decade |
| **Subtotal** | **20,150** | **22,920** | Aluminium still higher… |
| Resale premium | — | −5,500 | 1 % added value |
| **Net 10-yr cost** | **20,150** | **17,420** | Aluminium wins by £2,730 |

Extend to 25 years and the uPVC replacement cycle flips the equation dramatically—aluminium wins by **£11,000+**.

## Beyond Numbers: Comfort & Design

Sophie’s verdict after their first winter?

> “Our living room used to feel chilly unless the thermostat was at 22 °C. Now it’s 20 °C and cosy, with no cold-draft feeling by the glass. Plus the slim frames make the garden look like a picture frame.”

Slimmer sightlines deliver **12 % more glass area** in the Cartwright bay window—noticeable daylight gain that no spreadsheet can quantify.

---

## When uPVC *Is* the Sensible Choice

1. **Rental portfolios** where lowest cap-ex matters more than long-term savings.  
2. **Short-term ownership**: moving within five years.  
3. **Heritage rules**: some conservation officers prefer wood-look uPVC over aluminium.

For everyone else—particularly homeowners planning to stay a decade or more—aluminium repays its premium through energy, maintenance, and resale advantages.

## Decision Checklist

✔ Budget can stretch 50 % upfront?  
✔ Staying in the property > 10 years?  
✔ Value contemporary aesthetics & slim frames?  
✔ Prefer zero-maintenance colour stability?

If you tick three of four, aluminium is almost certainly your winner.
