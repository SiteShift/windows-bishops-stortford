faq:
  - question: "Do aluminium-clad timber windows rot or require extensive maintenance?"
    answer: "No, the aluminium exterior cladding completely protects the timber from weather exposure, preventing rot and eliminating the need for external painting. Internal timber may need occasional treatment, but overall maintenance is minimal compared to traditional timber windows."
  - question: "What's the typical lifespan of aluminium-clad timber windows vs solid timber?"
    answer: "Aluminium-clad timber windows typically last 40-60 years with minimal maintenance, compared to 25-40 years for solid timber windows. The aluminium cladding protects the timber from weathering, significantly extending lifespan while maintaining timber's insulation benefits."
  - question: "What's the maintenance schedule for aluminium-clad timber windows?"
    answer: "External maintenance is virtually zero – just occasional cleaning. Internal timber should be inspected annually and may need light treatment every 5-10 years. Hardware should be lubricated annually. This is significantly less than solid timber windows requiring external painting every 3-5 years."
  - question: "How much more do aluminium-clad timber windows cost compared to standard options?"
    answer: "Expect to pay 40-70% more than solid timber and 80-120% more than quality uPVC. For a typical window, costs range from £800-£1,500 compared to £500-£900 for timber or £300-£600 for uPVC. The premium reflects superior performance and longevity."
  - question: "Can aluminium-clad timber windows be painted different colours inside and outside?"
    answer: "Yes, this is one of their key advantages. The interior timber can be painted, stained, or left natural, while the exterior aluminium can be powder-coated in any RAL colour. This flexibility allows perfect matching to both interior design and external architectural requirements."
