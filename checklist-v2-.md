## Environment & Configuration  
- [x] Add `PLACES_API_KEY` to environment variables  
- [x] Configure `placesRadius` = 5000 m and `placesType` = "window glazing" in site data  

## Buildâ€‘Time Data Fetch  
- [x] Fetch nearby "window glazing" businesses within 5 km of Bishop's Stortford via the Places API  
- [x] Handle pagination to collect all results  
- [x] Extract: name, rating, user_ratings_total, vicinity, place_id  
- [x] For each `place_id`, fetch website and phone via Place Details endpoint  
- [x] Save a trimmed JSON array to `data/businesses.json`  

## Caching & Scheduled Rebuild  
- [x] Hook the fetch script to run automatically before each build  
- [x] (Optional) Schedule a monthly job to refresh `businesses.json` and trigger a redeploy  

## Data Modeling  
- [x] Define a `Business` type or interface with all required fields  
- [x] Ensure `data/businesses.json` conforms to that schema  

## BusinessList Component  
- [x] Import and iterate over `data/businesses.json` in a businessâ€‘listing component  
- [x] Render each item's name, rating, review count and address in plain HTML  
- [x] Display a "Get contact details" button that passes `place_id` to the lead form  
- [x] Inject JSONâ€‘LD markup for each entry as `LocalBusiness`  

## Lead Form Integration  
- [x] Accept `place_id` in the form's hidden field  
- [x] On successful submission, reveal or email the business's phone and website  

## Favicon Integration  
- [x] Use Google's favicon service for domain icons:  
  `https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain={domain}&sz={size}`  

## SEO & Performance  
- [x] Verify names, ratings and addresses appear in the HTML source (not clientâ€‘only)

- [x] Ensure the map widget loads clientâ€‘side only and causes no console errors  
- [x] Confirm Lighthouse SEO score remains â‰¥ 90 after adding business list  

## QA & Testing  
- [x] Run build and confirm `data/businesses.json` is populated correctly  
- [x] Inspect page source to ensure business list is rendered serverâ€‘side  
- [x] Simulate form submission and verify gated contacts appear  
- [x] Perform a Lighthouse audit (SEO â‰¥ 90, Performance â‰¥ 90)  
- [x] Check for any JavaScript errors in browser console
