## 📋 **Phase 1: Pre-Writing & Strategic Planning**

*Before you write a single word, complete this phase. This ensures every article has a clear purpose and strategy.*

### ✅ **1.1. Select Your Article & Define its Purpose**
- [ ] **Choose a Topic**: Select a supporting article title from the [Content Calendar in the Topical Map](Blog-Topical-map.md).
- [ ] **Identify the Core Intent**: Why is the user searching for this? 
    - *Informational*: They need to understand something (e.g., "What are U-Values?").
    - *Commercial Investigation*: They are comparing options (e.g., "uPVC vs Aluminium Windows").
    - *Transactional*: They are ready to buy/act (e.g., "How much does window installation cost?").
- [ ] **Define the Primary Keyword**: Identify the main search term from the topical map (e.g., "window installation cost Bishop’s Stortford").
- [ ] **Brainstorm Semantic Keywords**: List 5-10 related terms and questions (e.g., "cost to replace windows", "average price for uPVC windows", "local window fitters prices"). Use Google's "People also ask" for ideas.

### ✅ **1.2. Competitor & SERP Analysis**
- [ ] **Analyze Top 3 Rankings**: Google your primary keyword. What are the top 3 articles doing well? What are they missing?
- [ ] **Identify Content Gaps**: Find the unanswered questions or shallow explanations in competing articles. This is your opportunity to provide more value.
- [ ] **Note Competitor Structure**: How are their articles structured? What headings are they using?

### ✅ **1.3. Outline Your Article**
- [ ] **Draft a Compelling H1 Title**: It must include the primary keyword and location. (e.g., "How Much Does Window Installation Cost in Bishop’s Stortford? [2025 Guide]").
- [ ] **Structure with H2s & H3s**: Create a logical flow for your article using headings. Each heading should address a key subtopic. A typical structure:
    - H1: Main Title
    - H2: Introduction / The Problem
    - H2: Key Factors Influencing X
    - H2: Breakdown of Y
    - H2: Oliver's Expert Recommendation
    - H2: FAQ Section
    - H2: Conclusion & CTA
- [ ] **Plan Your 'Oliver's Take' Sections**: Identify 2-3 key areas where you can inject your 38 years of experience. This is crucial for E-A-T. (e.g., "Oliver's Take: The #1 Mistake Homeowners Make When Getting Quotes").

### ✅ **1.4. Map Your Internal Links**
- [ ] **Identify Parent Pillar/Cluster Link**: Find the main hub page this article belongs to (e.g., the "Costs & Financing" pillar). You will link up to this.
- [ ] **Identify 2-3 Peer Article Links**: Find other supporting articles to link to laterally (e.g., an article on cost could link to one on "Hidden Costs to Watch Out For" and "How to Compare Quotes").

---

## 📝 **Phase 2: Writing & Content Creation**

*Now, you write. Follow this structure to ensure every piece of content is world-class.*

### ✅ **2.1. Craft the Frontmatter (The Technical Bit)**
- [ ] **Open a new `.md` file** in `/src/content/blog/` with a keyword-rich filename (e.g., `window-installation-cost-bishops-stortford.md`).
- [ ] **Fill out the YAML frontmatter** at the very top of the file. This is non-negotiable for SEO.

faq:
  - question: "Is it cheaper to replace all windows at once in Bishop's Stortford?"
    answer: "Yes, generally it is. Replacing all windows at once reduces costs for labour, scaffolding, and materials. Most local installers in Bishop's Stortford offer a better price for a whole-house job."
  - question: "What's the average cost for a 3-bedroom house window replacement?"
    answer: "For a typical 3-bed house in Hertfordshire, you can expect to pay between £5,000 and £9,000 for uPVC windows, depending on the exact number and style of windows."
  - question: "Do I need planning permission for new windows in Bishop's Stortford?"
    answer: "Usually not, if the windows are of a similar appearance. However, if you are in a conservation area in Bishop's Stortford or a listed building, you absolutely must check with the local council. I've seen homeowners face hefty fines for this."
