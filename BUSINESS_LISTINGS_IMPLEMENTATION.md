## üìã **What Was Built**

### 1. **Build-Time Data Fetching** (`scripts/fetch-businesses.js`)
- Fetches window glazing businesses within 5km of Bishop's Stortford
- Uses Google Places API Nearby Search + Place Details
- Filters businesses with rating ‚â• 3.0 stars  
- Extracts: name, rating, reviews, address, website, phone, domain
- Sorts by quality score: `rating √ó log(reviews + 1)`
- Rate-limited API calls with error handling
- Saves to `src/data/businesses.json`

### 2. **TypeScript Interfaces** (`src/types/business.ts`)
```typescript
interface Business {
  place_id: string;
  name: string;
  rating: number;
  user_ratings_total: number;
  vicinity: string;
  website: string | null;
  phone: string | null;
  google_url: string;
  domain: string | null;
  types: string[];
  price_level: number | null;
}
```

### 3. **BusinessList Component** (`src/components/BusinessList.astro`)
- Server-side rendered for SEO
- Responsive grid layout (1/2/3 columns)
- Business cards with:
  - Company favicon from Google's service
  - Star ratings (‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ format)
  - Review counts and business types
  - Website links and Google Maps links
  - "Get Contact Details" buttons
- Schema.org LocalBusiness markup for each listing
- Hidden contact details sections (revealed after form submission)

### 4. **Gated Contact System**
- "Get Contact Details" buttons scroll to contact form
- Pre-fills form with business context
- Adds hidden fields: `selected_business_place_id`, `selected_business_name`
- On successful form submission, reveals phone/website instead of redirecting
- Analytics tracking for business contact requests

### 5. **Enhanced Contact Form** (Updated `src/components/ContactForm.astro`)
- Detects business contact requests via hidden fields
- Shows contact details inline instead of redirecting
- Maintains all original functionality for direct enquiries
- Success message customization
- Analytics event tracking

## üîß **Technical Architecture**

### Build Process Integration
```bash
npm run build                    # Fetches businesses + builds site
npm run build:astro             # Builds without fetching (development)
npm run fetch-businesses        # Manual data refresh
```

### Environment Configuration
```env
PLACES_API_KEY=your_google_places_api_key_here
PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_maps_key_here
```

### Data Flow
1. **Build Time**: `scripts/fetch-businesses.js` ‚Üí `src/data/businesses.json`
