    answer: "Neglecting the paintwork. Paint isn't just decorative - it's your timber's primary protection against moisture.

## The Complete Timber Window Maintenance Checklist for Bishop's Stortford Homes

Timber windows are the crown jewel of any period property. When properly maintained, they can last centuries while providing character, charm, and excellent performance. But here's the reality I've learned over 38 years: **timber windows are only as good as the care you give them.**

I'm Oliver Greene, and I've restored, repaired, and maintained thousands of timber windows across Hertfordshire. Today, I'm sharing my comprehensive maintenance checklist—the same systematic approach I use to keep timber windows in Bishop's Stortford homes looking beautiful and functioning perfectly for generations.

Whether you own a Victorian terrace, an Edwardian semi, or a Georgian townhouse, this guide will help you protect your investment and avoid the costly mistakes I see all too often.

**Concerned about your timber windows?** [Book a professional maintenance assessment](/contact) with our Bishop's Stortford specialists who understand the unique challenges of Hertfordshire's climate.

## Why Timber Window Maintenance is Critical in Bishop's Stortford

Our local climate is particularly challenging for timber windows. The combination of wet winters, temperature fluctuations, and occasional summer heat puts constant stress on wood and paintwork. Add to this the age of many Bishop's Stortford properties—many dating back 100+ years—and regular maintenance becomes absolutely essential.

### The Cost of Neglect
- **Minor maintenance**: £50-£150 per window annually
- **Major restoration**: £800-£1,500 per window
- **Full replacement**: £1,200-£3,000+ per window

The mathematics is clear: prevention is always cheaper than cure.

## Spring Maintenance Checklist (March-April)

Spring is the perfect time for a thorough inspection after winter's punishment.

### Exterior Inspection
- [ ] **Check paintwork**: Look for peeling, cracking, or bubbling paint, especially on the sill and bottom rail where water collects.
- [ ] **Inspect putty/glazing compound**: Press gently around the glass. Soft or cracked putty needs immediate attention.
- [ ] **Examine timber condition**: Use a penknife to gently probe suspect areas. Soft, spongy wood indicates rot.
- [ ] **Check drainage**: Ensure weep holes in the sill are clear and water can drain away freely.
- [ ] **Assess caulking**: Look at the seal between the frame and masonry. Replace if cracked or missing.

### Interior Inspection
- [ ] **Test operation**: Open and close each window. Note any sticking, binding, or difficulty.
- [ ] **Check locks and hardware**: Ensure all catches, stays, and hinges operate smoothly.
- [ ] **Inspect sash cords**: Look for fraying or wear on traditional sash windows.
- [ ] **Examine seals**: Check weatherstripping and draught-proofing for wear.

### Oliver's Take: The "Tap Test"
"Here's a professional trick I've used for decades: gently tap the timber with the handle of a screwdriver. Healthy timber sounds solid and clear. Rotten timber sounds dull and hollow. This simple test can identify problems before they become visible, potentially saving you thousands."

## Summer Maintenance Tasks (June-August)

Summer's dry conditions are ideal for painting and repairs.

### Painting and Finishing
- [ ] **Prepare surfaces**: Sand back any loose or flaking paint to bare wood.
- [ ] **Prime exposed timber**: Use a high-quality wood primer on any bare areas.
- [ ] **Apply undercoat**: Essential for a durable finish—never skip this step.
- [ ] **Top coat application**: Use a premium exterior wood paint, applying thin, even coats.
- [ ] **Reglaze as needed**: Replace any loose or missing glazing putty.

### Hardware Maintenance
- [ ] **Lubricate hinges**: Use a light machine oil, wiping away excess.
- [ ] **Adjust catches**: Ensure windows close snugly without forcing.
- [ ] **Replace worn weatherstripping**: Upgrade to modern brush or compression seals if appropriate.

## Autumn Preparation Checklist (September-November)

Preparing for winter is crucial for timber window longevity.

### Weatherproofing
- [ ] **Check and renew exterior caulk**: Focus on areas where water might penetrate.
- [ ] **Clean and clear gutters**: Overflowing gutters are a major cause of timber window damage.
- [ ] **Trim vegetation**: Cut back any plants that touch the windows—they hold moisture against the timber.
- [ ] **Apply wood preservative**: If you have unpainted timber, treat with a quality preservative.

### Draught-Proofing
- [ ] **Install or renew draught strips**: Modern brush seals can dramatically improve comfort and efficiency.
- [ ] **Check window putty**: Renew any areas that have shrunk or cracked over summer.
- [ ] **Adjust window catches**: Ensure a tight seal without over-stressing the timber.

## Winter Care (December-February)

Winter maintenance focuses on monitoring and minor adjustments.

### Monthly Checks
- [ ] **Wipe down condensation**: Don't let moisture sit on timber surfaces.
- [ ] **Check for ice damage**: Look for any splitting or movement after freezing weather.
- [ ] **Monitor for draughts**: Note any new cold spots that might indicate seal failure.
- [ ] **Keep drainage clear**: Remove leaves and debris from sills and drainage channels.

## The 5-Year Deep Maintenance Cycle

Some tasks don't need annual attention but are crucial for long-term health.

### Every 5 Years
- [ ] **Complete paint system renewal**: Strip back to bare wood and start fresh.
- [ ] **Replace all glazing putty**: Even if it looks okay, 5-year renewal prevents problems.
- [ ] **Overhaul hardware**: Service or replace catches, hinges, and stays.
- [ ] **Professional draught-proofing upgrade**: Install the latest sealing technology.

### Every 10 Years
- [ ] **Comprehensive restoration assessment**: Professional evaluation of timber condition.
- [ ] **Sash cord replacement**: For traditional sash windows, renew all cords and chains.
- [ ] **Structural repairs**: Address any timber decay or joint failure.
