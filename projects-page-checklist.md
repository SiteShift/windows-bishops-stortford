# Projects Page Implementation Checklist

## Overview
Create a comprehensive `/projects` showcase page for window installation projects using Google Imagen 4 API for photorealistic project imagery. This will demonstrate completed work and drive conversions through visual proof of quality.

## Phase 1: Data Structure & Content Planning ‚úÖ

### 1.1 Create Projects Data Schema
- [ ] Design `src/data/projects.json` structure
- [ ] Include 5 realistic project examples with:

  - `title` (project name)
  - `location` (Bishop's Stortford area)
  - `windowType` (casement, sash, tilt & turn, etc.)
  - `material` (uPVC, aluminium, timber)
  - `color` (anthracite grey, white, black, etc.)
  - `description` (detailed project story)
  - `beforeImage` (placeholder path)
  - `afterImage` (placeholder path)
  - `imagenPrompt` (optimized for Google Imagen 4)
  - `completionDate`
  - `propertyType` (Victorian terrace, modern detached, etc.)
  - `specifications` (technical details)
  - `customerTestimonial` (optional)

### 1.2 Imagen Prompt Strategy
Create photorealistic prompts following format:
*"Photorealistic exterior view of [property type] home in [location] with new [color] [material] [window type] windows, British architecture, natural daylight, high resolution, architectural photography style"*

Examples:
- Victorian terrace with white uPVC sash windows
